The programmee requests for you to input the total number of units of the courses you offered, or that you would like to calculate the cgpa of. 
It then requests for the grade and unit of each of the courses with example of how it should be written. E.g B,3 which means you had a grade of B and that the course was a 3 unit course.
A,2 would mean you had a grade of A in a 2 unit course.
The cgpa would calculate for each grade you put in using the total number of courses you offered, the one you provided at the beginning of the code. This would happen for every grade you add.
once you are done with providing all your grades, you should type "stop" to end the programme. You shall be provided with your final cgpa. 
Updates are coming, or not.
